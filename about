Implementation and construction of a parse tree for a propositional logical formula in infix notation. 

The connective symbols used are as follows : 
          ~ for negation
          + for OR
          * for AND
          > for implication
          
Tasks : 
        Task 1: 
        A function to convert the infix propositional logic expression into a prefix propositional logic.
        expression. 
        Task 2:
        A function to convert the prefix expression into a rooted binary parse tree. 
        Task 3:
        A function to traverse the parse tree to output the infix expression back by in-order traversal of the
        parse tree.
        Task 4:
        A function to compute the height of a parse tree.
        Task 5:
        A function to evaluate the truth value of a propositional logic formula, given the truth values of
        each propositional atom by traversing the tree in a bottom up fashion.
